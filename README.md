## About the Bullet Journal

This app is inspired by the [bullet journal](https://bulletjournal.com/) philosophy for task planning. Although using a paper notebook has a romantic appeal, I can't draw straight lines. The web application takes care of the setup for planning daily tasks, allowing the user to focus exclusively on recording and updating them.

## Coming Soon:

- Monthly task view
- Task editor

## Using Next:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
